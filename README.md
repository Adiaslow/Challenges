# Challenges

## Usage:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Find the appropriate solution_template.py.
3. Make a copy and name it something (e.g. someones_original_solution.py or someones_optimized_solution.py).
4. Solve the problem!
5. Commit your solution.

## Guidelines
- Try to come up with your own solution before researching other solutions.
- If you're stuck, do only enough research to get going in the right direction.
  - Try to research fundamentals instead of full solutions.
- When you've finished your own solution, commit it.
- If you've finished your own solution, do some research and optimize it.
- When you've optimized your solution, commit it seperately from your original solution.

## Best Practices
- Use [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to keep your code clean and readable.
- Leave comments to help others understand what you are doing.
- Don't mess with other's code.
- Live by the tenets of [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python).
